To fix the display offset error, modify the u8x8_d_ssd1306_128x64_noname.c file in the U8g2 library
and correct the default_x_offset parameter to 0 instead of 2 int u8x8_sh1106_128x64_noname_display_info constructor

Also the current way of setting LED colours ignores the on/off state of an LED and will set it's colour in both the LED's memory and the FastLED strip. 
So if you want it to be off but set the colour and toggle it on later immediately set the state off or just use black and colours to toggle on/off.
