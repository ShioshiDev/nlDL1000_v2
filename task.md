# ESP32 DL1000 Factory State Machine Refactor - âœ… COMPLETED

## Project Overview
Major refactor of ESP32 Arduino PlatformIO project to implement robust state machine driven architecture for networking and MQTT services with accurate state tracking.

## Remaining Optional Tasks

### Future Enhancements (Not Critical)
- **OTA Manager**: Extract OTA functionality to separate module (currently integrated in ServicesManager)
- **Factory Reset Manager**: Extract factory reset to separate module (currently in coreManager)
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive docs in `docs/` folder for architecture overview

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Machine Architecture
- **Pattern**: Based on example templates with Manager naming convention
- **States**: Comprehensive state tracking for all network and service conditions
- **Transitions**: Clean state transitions with proper event handling
- **Non-blocking**: All operations designed for smooth device operation

### StatusViewModel Pattern
- **Design**: C++ class with dirty flag pattern for efficient change detection
- **Usage**: Centralized state management for display and LED updates
- **Performance**: Only updates when state actually changes
- **Thread-safe**: Designed for multi-manager access

### Ethernet Integration
- **Driver**: EthernetESP32 with W5500 support
- **Features**: IP connectivity, internet connectivity, and service connectivity states
- **Events**: Comprehensive event handling for all connection scenarios

### MQTT Services
- **Library**: PicoMQTT for lightweight MQTT client
- **Topics**: Device registration, command handling, status reporting
- **Integration**: OTA update hooks and device management functionality
